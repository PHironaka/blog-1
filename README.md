# charlie's blog

Source code for my static site/blog. 

Posts can be written in either Markdown or React. 

Why both? Welp, the React posts can handle any cool interactive / animation stuff I want to include.

### Write a new post (in either Markdown or React)
```bash
npm install
./scripts/new-post.sh
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### To-do / fixes

* Gifs are manually included right now because not available via Sharp
